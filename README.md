## Overview

Flood Escape 2(D) is a fan-made 2D reinterpretation of the popular Roblox game Flood Escape 2 by Crazyblox. Inspired specifically by Castle Tides—the easiest level in the original game created by Jolluminati—this project brings the thrilling flood escape experience into a simple yet engaging 2D format.

Built using Godot 4 and GDScript, Flood Escape 2(D) was developed as part of Hack Club’s Jumpstart Program, aiming to recreate and explore game design principles through community-driven projects.

## Features

	•	Faithful 2D adaptation of Flood Escape 2 gameplay mechanics
	•	Level inspired by Castle Tides, providing accessible gameplay
	•	Developed with Godot 4 for modern game engine capabilities
	•	Open source and community-driven for further contributions

## Controls & How to Play
    Controls:

	•	Arrow keys for movement

    Buttons:

	•	Press the green button (move the player onto them) to advance and activate the next buttons!
	•	Once (and only once) you've pressed all the buttons in a room, you can advance to the next room by moving the player to the right edge of the screen
	•	Green button = active, this is the button you should press next. Yellow button = inactive, press the others first! Blue button = group button, it's only you but it's meant to mimick the real FE2! Black/dark/off button = deactivated, you already pressed it.

    Objective:

	•	Advance through all three rooms to escape and win... before the rising flood waters get you!
	•	The flood waters might rise slowly, but they rise steadily. Move fast!
	•	Water decreases your oxygen level by 8 per second. You have 100 in your "lungs."

## DISCLAIMERS

	•	Some of the code and the readme was written with the assistance of AI, but most of it was handwritten. This is still a project written by me, despite the AI disclosure listed on the itch.io page.
	•	There are no flood waters in the game because I haven't coded them yet. The itch.io page says the game is complete because I might leave the game like this (I used this as an introduction to game development). Feel free to contribute; thank you very much if you do!
